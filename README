This is a complete set of OCaml bindings around libvirt, exposing all
known functionality to OCaml programs.


Requirements
----------------------------------------------------------------------

PLEASE NOTE: The list of requirements looks long but you DO NOT NEED
all of these packages, so pay careful attention to what is required
('R') and what is optional ('O').

ALSO NOTE: Binaries are available for many platforms.  You only need
the packages below if you want to build from source.

Note [1]: Findlib was recently ported to Windows and in future we may
require it because it will let us remove a lot of hacks from the
Makefiles.

Note [2]: It's not clear if ocaml-gettext works on Windows.

Building
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  ./configure           # Checks that you have all the required bits.

  make all		# Builds the bytecode version of libs/programs.
  make opt		# Builds the native code version of libs/programs.

  make install          # Install in OCaml directory, and the binaries
       			# in $prefix/bin.

  make doc              # Build HTML documentation in html/ subdirectory.

Then have a look at the programs 'mlvirsh.opt', 'virt-top.opt'
and 'virt-ctrl.opt'.

Note: If you want to run the programs without first installing, you
may need to set your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable so it
contains the build directory.  eg:

  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=libvirt/ mlvirsh/mlvirsh.opt


Windows
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I have built libvirt (the bindings), examples, mlvirsh and virt-ctrl
on Windows using the MinGW port of OCaml.  It's quite likely that it
will also work under VC++, but I have not tested this.

You should make sure that your $PATH (environment variable) contains
the names of the directories containing all required DLLs, in
particular you will require:

  libvirt-*.dll		(from libvirt)
  libgnutls-*.dll	(from GnuTLS)
  libgcrypt-*.dll
  libgpg-error-*.dll
  libtasn1-*.dll
  libxdr.dll		(from libxdr)
  libxml2-*.dll		(from libxml2)
  and, a multitude of DLLs from GTK if you want to run virt-ctrl

You can use a tool such as Dependency Walker to find/check the
locations of dependent libraries.

To build the Windows installer, you will need NSIS.  Then do:

  ./configure --with-nsis=/c/Progra~1/NSIS
  make all opt
  make wininstaller

This should build a Windows binary installer called
ocaml-libvirt-$VERSION.exe which includes the bindings, all required
DLLs and all programs that can be built under Windows.


mlvirsh
----------------------------------------------------------------------

'mlvirsh' is an almost complete reimplementation of virsh, which is
mostly command compatible (there are a very few commands missing, and
some commands have a slightly different syntax, but broadly speaking
they are equivalent programs except that one is written in C and the
other in OCaml).

At the time of writing:

              wc -c  wc -l

  virsh     126,056  4,641
  mlvirsh    19,427    598

  % size        15%    13%


virt-ctrl
----------------------------------------------------------------------

'virt-ctrl' (originally called 'mlvirtmanager') is a reimplementation
of virt-manager in OCaml.  It is not feature-complete by any means,
but does allow you to show the running domains and start and stop
defined domains.  The main functionality _missing_ is the ability to
define new virtual machines, change the resources allocated to
domains, or show the machine console.


Programming
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For documentation on these bindings, read libvirt.mli and/or 'make
doc' and browse the HTML documentation in the html/ subdirectory.
