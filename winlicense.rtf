                          675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA\par
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\par
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\par
\par
\tab\tab\tab     Preamble\par
\par
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\par
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\par
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\par
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\par
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\par
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\par
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\par
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\par
your programs, too.\par
\par
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\par
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\par
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\par
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\par
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\par
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\par
\par
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\par
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\par
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\par
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\par
\par
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\par
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\par
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\par
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\par
rights.\par
\par
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\par
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\par
distribute and/or modify the software.\par
\par
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\par
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\par
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\par
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\par
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\par
authors' reputations.\par
\par
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\par
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\par
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\par
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\par
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\par
\par
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\par
modification follow.\par
\page\par
\tab\tab     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\par
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\par
\par
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\par
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\par
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,\par
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"\par
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\par
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\par
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\par
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\par
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".\par
\par
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\par
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\par
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\par
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\par
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\par
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\par
\par
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\par
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\par
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\par
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\par
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\par
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\par
along with the Program.\par
\par
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\par
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\par
\par
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\par
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\par
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\par
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\par
\par
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\par
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\par
\par
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\par
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\par
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\par
    parties under the terms of this License.\par
\par
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\par
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\par
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\par
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\par
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\par
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\par
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\par
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\par
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\par
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\par
\page\par
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\par
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\par
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\par
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\par
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\par
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\par
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\par
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\par
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\par
\par
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\par
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\par
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\par
collective works based on the Program.\par
\par
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\par
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\par
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\par
the scope of this License.\par
\par
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\par
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\par
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\par
\par
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\par
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\par
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\par
\par
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\par
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\par
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\par
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\par
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\par
    customarily used for software interchange; or,\par
\par
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\par
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\par
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\par
    received the program in object code or executable form with such\par
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\par
\par
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\par
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\par
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\par
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\par
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\par
special exception, the source code distributed need not include\par
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\par
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\par
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\par
itself accompanies the executable.\par
\par
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\par
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\par
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\par
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\par
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\par
\page\par
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\par
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\par
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\par
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\par
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\par
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\par
parties remain in full compliance.\par
\par
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\par
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\par
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\par
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\par
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\par
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\par
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\par
the Program or works based on it.\par
\par
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\par
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\par
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\par
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\par
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\par
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\par
this License.\par
\par
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\par
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\par
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\par
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\par
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\par
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\par
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\par
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\par
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\par
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\par
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\par
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\par
\par
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\par
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\par
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\par
circumstances.\par
\par
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\par
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\par
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\par
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\par
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\par
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\par
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\par
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\par
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\par
impose that choice.\par
\par
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\par
be a consequence of the rest of this License.\par
\page\par
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\par
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\par
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\par
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\par
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\par
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\par
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\par
\par
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\par
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\par
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\par
address new problems or concerns.\par
\par
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\par
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any\par
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\par
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\par
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\par
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\par
Foundation.\par
\par
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\par
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\par
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\par
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\par
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\par
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\par
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\par
\par
\tab\tab\tab     NO WARRANTY\par
\par
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\par
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\par
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\par
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\par
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\par
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\par
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\par
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\par
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\par
\par
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\par
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\par
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\par
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\par
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\par
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\par
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\par
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\par
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\par
\par
\tab\tab      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\par
\page\par
\tab     How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\par
\par
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\par
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\par
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\par
\par
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\par
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\par
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\par
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\par
\par
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\par
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>\par
\par
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\par
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\par
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\par
    (at your option) any later version.\par
\par
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\par
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\par
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\par
    GNU General Public License for more details.\par
\par
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\par
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\par
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.\par
\par
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\par
\par
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\par
when it starts in an interactive mode:\par
\par
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author\par
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\par
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\par
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\par
\par
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\par
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\par
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\par
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\par
\par
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\par
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if\par
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\par
\par
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\par
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\par

\par
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\par
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\par
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\par
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General\par
Public License instead of this License.\par

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\par
     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\par
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\par
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\par
\par
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts\par
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\par
 the version number 2.1.]\par
\par
                            Preamble\par
\par
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\par
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\par
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\par
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\par
\par
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\par
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\par
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\par
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\par
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\par
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\par
below.\par
\par
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\par
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\par
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\par
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\par
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\par
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\par
these things.\par
\par
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\par
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\par
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\par
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\par
\par
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\par
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\par
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\par
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\par
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\par
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\par
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\par
\par
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\par
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\par
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\par
\par
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\par
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\par
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\par
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\par
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\par
introduced by others.\par
^L\par
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\par
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\par
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\par
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\par
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\par
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\par
\par
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\par
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\par
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\par
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\par
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\par
libraries into non-free programs.\par
\par
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\par
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\par
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\par
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\par
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\par
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\par
the library.\par
\par
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\par
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\par
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\par
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\par
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\par
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\par
special circumstances.\par
\par
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\par
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\par
becomes\par
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\par
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\par
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\par
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\par
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\par
\par
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\par
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\par
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\par
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\par
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\par
system.\par
\par
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\par
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\par
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\par
that program using a modified version of the Library.\par
\par
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\par
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\par
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\par
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\par
be combined with the library in order to run.\par
^L\par
                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\par
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\par
\par
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\par
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\par
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\par
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\par
Each licensee is addressed as "you".\par
\par
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\par
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\par
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\par
\par
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\par
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\par
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\par
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\par
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\par
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\par
included without limitation in the term "modification".)\par
\par
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\par
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\par
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\par
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\par
compilation\par
and installation of the library.\par
\par
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\par
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\par
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\par
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\par
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\par
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\par
and what the program that uses the Library does.\par
\par
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\par
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\par
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\par
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\par
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\par
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\par
Library.\par
\par
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\par
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\par
fee.\par
\page\par
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\par
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\par
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\par
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\par
\par
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\par
\par
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\par
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\par
\par
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\par
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\par
\par
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\par
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\par
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\par
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\par
    in the event an application does not supply such function or\par
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\par
    its purpose remains meaningful.\par
\par
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\par
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\par
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\par
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\par
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\par
    root function must still compute square roots.)\par
\par
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\par
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\par
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\par
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\par
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\par
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\par
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\par
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\par
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\par
it.\par
\par
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\par
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\par
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\par
collective works based on the Library.\par
\par
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\par
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\par
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\par
the scope of this License.\par
\par
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\par
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\par
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\par
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\par
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\par
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\par
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\par
these notices.\par
^L\par
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\par
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\par
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\par
\par
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\par
the Library into a program that is not a library.\par
\par
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\par
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\par
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\par
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\par
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\par
medium customarily used for software interchange.\par
\par
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\par
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\par
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\par
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\par
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\par
\par
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\par
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\par
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\par
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\par
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\par
\par
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\par
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\par
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\par
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\par
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\par
\par
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\par
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\par
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\par
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\par
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\par
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\par
\par
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\par
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\par
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\par
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\par
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\par
Library will still fall under Section 6.)\par
\par
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\par
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\par
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\par
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\par
^L\par
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\par
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\par
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\par
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\par
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\par
engineering for debugging such modifications.\par
\par
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\par
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\par
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\par
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\par
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\par
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\par
of these things:\par
\par
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\par
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\par
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\par
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\par
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\par
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\par
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\par
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\par
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\par
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\par
    to use the modified definitions.)\par
\par
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\par
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\par
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\par
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\par
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\par
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\par
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\par
\par
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\par
    least three years, to give the same user the materials\par
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\par
    than the cost of performing this distribution.\par
\par
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\par
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\par
    specified materials from the same place.\par
\par
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\par
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\par
\par
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\par
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\par
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\par
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\par
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\par
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\par
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\par
the executable.\par
\par
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\par
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\par
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\par
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\par
distribute.\par
^L\par
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\par
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\par
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\par
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\par
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\par
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\par
\par
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\par
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\par
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\par
    Sections above.\par
\par
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\par
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\par
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\par
\par
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\par
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\par
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\par
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\par
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\par
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\par
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\par
\par
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\par
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\par
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\par
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\par
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\par
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\par
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\par
the Library or works based on it.\par
\par
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\par
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\par
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\par
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\par
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\par
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\par
this License.\par
^L\par
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\par
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\par
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\par
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\par
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\par
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\par
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\par
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\par
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\par
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\par
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\par
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\par
\par
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\par
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\par
apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\par
circumstances.\par
\par
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\par
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\par
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\par
integrity of the free software distribution system which is\par
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\par
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\par
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\par
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\par
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\par
impose that choice.\par
\par
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\par
be a consequence of the rest of this License.\par
\par
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\par
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\par
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License\par
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\par
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\par
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\par
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\par
\par
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\par
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\par
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\par
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\par
\par
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\par
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\par
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\par
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\par
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\par
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\par
the Free Software Foundation.\par
^L\par
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\par
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\par
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\par
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\par
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\par
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\par
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\par
and reuse of software generally.\par
\par
                            NO WARRANTY\par
\par
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\par
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\par
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\par
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\par
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\par
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\par
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\par
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\par
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\par
\par
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\par
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\par
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\par
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\par
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\par
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\par
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\par
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\par
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\par
DAMAGES.\par
\par
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\par
^L\par
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\par
\par
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\par
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\par
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\par
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\par
of the ordinary General Public License).\par
\par
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\par
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\par
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\par
have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full\par
notice is found.\par
\par
\par
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it\par
does.>\par
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\par
\par
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\par
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\par
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\par
    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\par
\par
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\par
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\par
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\par
    Lesser General Public License for more details.\par
\par
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\par
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\par
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301  USA\par
\par
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper\par
mail.\par
\par
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\par
your\par
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if\par
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\par
\par
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\par
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James\par
Random Hacker.\par
